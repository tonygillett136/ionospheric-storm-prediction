## Enhanced Architecture Details

### Input Layer (24 timesteps × 16 features)

#### Enhanced Feature Set:
1-2. **TEC Statistics**: mean, std (normalized)
3-4. **Geomagnetic Indices**: Kp (0-9), Dst (-100 to +100 nT)
5-6. **Solar Wind**: speed (km/s), density (particles/cm³)
7. **IMF Bz**: Interplanetary magnetic field Z-component (nT)
8-9. **Solar Activity**: F10.7 flux, 81-day average
10-11. **Hour of Day**: sin/cos encoding (captures diurnal variation)
12-13. **Day of Year**: sin/cos encoding (captures seasonal effects)
14. **Derived: Solar Wind Pressure**: ρv² (dynamic pressure)
15. **Derived: Ephemeral Correlation Time**: Storm persistence indicator
16. **Derived: TEC Rate of Change**: Temporal derivative

### Encoder: Feature Extraction

```
Input (24, 16)
    ↓
CNN Block 1: Conv1D(128) + LayerNorm + Dropout(0.2)
    ↓ (residual connection)
CNN Block 1b: Conv1D(128) + LayerNorm
    ↓ [Add residual]
CNN Block 2: Conv1D(256) + LayerNorm + MaxPool(2) + Dropout(0.2)
    ↓ (residual connection)
CNN Block 2b: Conv1D(256) + LayerNorm
    ↓ [Add residual]
```

**Why CNN first?**
- Extracts local temporal patterns (short-term correlations)
- Reduces sequence length for efficient LSTM processing
- Captures multi-scale features through different kernel sizes

### Temporal Modeling: BiLSTM + Attention

```
BiLSTM Layer 1: 256 units (bidirectional = 512 outputs)
    ↓
LayerNormalization
    ↓
Multi-Head Attention (8 heads, 512 dimensions)
    ↓ (residual connection)
[Add residual] + LayerNormalization
    ↓
BiLSTM Layer 2: 128 units (bidirectional = 256 outputs)
    ↓
LayerNormalization
    ↓
GlobalAveragePooling + GlobalMaxPooling → Concatenate
    ↓ (512 dimensions)
```

**Key Innovations:**
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Processes sequences in both directions, capturing future context
- **Multi-Head Attention**: 8 attention heads learn different temporal patterns
- **Residual Connections**: Allow gradients to flow directly, enabling deeper networks
- **Dual Pooling**: Avg pool captures general trends, max pool captures peaks

### Decoder: Prediction Heads

```
Dense(512) + LayerNorm + Dropout(0.3)
    ↓ (residual connection)
Dense(512) + LayerNorm
    ↓ [Add residual]
Dense(256) + LayerNorm + Dropout(0.2)
    ↓
[Split into 4 prediction heads]
```

#### Output Heads:

1. **Storm Binary** (sigmoid): Single probability for 24h ahead storm
   - Loss weight: 3.0 (highest priority)
   - Metrics: Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall

2. **Storm Probability** (sigmoid, 24 values): Hourly probabilities
   - Loss weight: 2.0
   - Allows detailed temporal analysis

3. **TEC Forecast** (linear, 24 values): Predicted TEC values
   - Loss: Huber (robust to outliers)
   - Loss weight: 1.0

4. **Uncertainty** (sigmoid): Model confidence estimate
   - Loss weight: 0.5
   - Enables risk-aware decision making

## Training Pipeline Improvements

3. **Train/Val/Test Split**: 70% / 15% / 15% (temporal ordering preserved)

### Training Configuration

```python
Optimizer: AdamW (learning_rate=0.001, weight_decay=0.0001)
Batch Size: 32
Epochs: 100 (with early stopping)
Loss Functions:
  - storm_binary: binary_crossentropy

### Using the Trained Model

```python
from app.models.storm_predictor_v2 import EnhancedStormPredictor

# Load trained model
predictor = EnhancedStormPredictor(model_path="models/v2/best_model.keras")

# Make prediction
prediction = await predictor.predict_storm(historical_data)

# Access results
storm_prob = prediction['storm_probability_24h']
uncertainty = prediction['uncertainty']
confidence = prediction['confidence']
risk_level = prediction['risk_level']
```

## Integration with Existing System

The V2 model is designed to be a drop-in replacement for V1:

1. **Same Interface**: `predict_storm()` method signature unchanged
2. **Enhanced Outputs**: Additional fields (uncertainty, confidence)

```python
# In app/services/data_service.py
from app.models.storm_predictor_v2 import EnhancedStormPredictor
self.predictor = EnhancedStormPredictor(model_path="models/v2/best_model.keras")
```

## Validation Strategy

1. **Test multiple time periods**: Different seasons, solar activity levels
2. **Test various thresholds**: 30%, 40%, 50% storm thresholds
3. **Compare metrics**: RMSE, MAE, Precision, Recall, F1, FAR
4. **Analyze failure modes**: When does the model fail? Why?

### Key Validation Metrics

- **RMSE < 20%**: Good probabilistic accuracy
